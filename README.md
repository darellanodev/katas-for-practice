# What is a kata

A kata is a set sequence of movements used in martial arts training, like karate. It helps practitioners practice and perfect specific techniques through repetition. Each kata simulates a combat scenario, allowing students to improve their skills and muscle memory. The concept has also been adopted in other fields, such as programming, to encourage structured practice and learning.

# Katas for practice

This is a collection of katas that I am creating to practice various programming languages.

Currently, I'm doing Katas on the Codewars website for practice.

I might upload some of these Katas to the Codewars community.
